# 🗓️ Weeks Before June – Warm-up Study Notes

## 📌 Purpose
This file logs everything I’ve done from the last week of May to prepare for my Full-Stack Web Developer journey (starting June 2025). Includes coding warm-ups, practice challenges, setup progress, and self-reflections.

## ✅ Practice Challenges Completed

### 🔹 JavaScript Mini Challenges
1. **Square Sum Function** – practiced `for loop`, squaring values
    - My Initial Solution:

        ```js
        function squareSum(numbers) {
            let result = 0;
            for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            numbers[i] **= 2;
            result += numbers[i];
            }
            return result;
        }
        ```

    - Refactored Solution:
        ```js
        function squareSum(numbers){
            return numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num ** 2, 0);
        }
        ```

    - ✅ Learned: Looping, mutation caution

2. **Convert Number to String**
    - My Initial Solution:

        ```js
        function numberToString(num) {
            return num.toString();
        }
        ```

    - Refactored Solution:

        ```js
        function numberToString(num) {
            return String(num);
        }

    - Learned: Type casting basics

3. **Positive Sum Challenge**

    - My Initial Solution:

        ```js
        function positiveSum(arr) {
            let positiveOnes = 0;
            
            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                if (arr[i] > 0) {
                    positiveOnes += arr[i];
                }
            }
            return positiveOnes;
        }
        ```

    - Refactored Solution:

        ```js
        function positiveSum(arr) {
            return arr.filter(num => num > 0).reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
        }
        ```

4. **Perfect Square Checker**

    - My Initital Solution:

        ```js
        var isSquare = function(n){
            let squareBuildingBlocks = Math.round(Math.sqrt(n));
            
            if (squareBuildingBlocks === 0) {
                return true;
            } else if (squareBuildingBlocks * squareBuildingBlocks === n) {
                return true; 
            } else {
                return false;
            }
            
        }

    - Refactored Solution:

        ```js
        var isSquare = function(n){
            return Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n));
        }
        ```

5. **Count by X**

    - My Initial Solution:

        ```js
            function countBy(x, n) {
                let z = [];
                let counter = 0;

                for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++>) {
                    if (z.length !== n) {
                        counter += x;
                        z.push(counter);
                    } else {
                        return z;
                    }
                }
            }
        ```

    - Refactored Solution:

        ```js
        function countBy(x, n) {
            let result = [];
            for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                result.push(i * x);
            }
            return result;
        }

        ```


6. **Convert Hours into Seconds**

    - My Initial Solution:

        ```js
            function howManySeconds(hours) {
                return hours * 3600;
            }
        ```

    - No refactored needed.




## 🧠 Reflections

- I often use AI to generate the logic first, then try to understand it line by line.
- ➤ That’s okay for now, but I want to start writing from scratch more often by mid-June.

- My Trello setup is done ✅ — it’s helping me stay organized with my weekly and monthly focus.

- Created a GitHub repo to track my learning: https://github.com/edmyrbatiancila/full-stack-journey

- I went back to read previous challenges that I did specifically in first challenge that I resolved called 'squareSum'. In this challenge I used a for loops which is a very basic one. Now I realized that there is a different approach to that by using reduce which is one of the method for arrays. After using the reduce I only consume one line of code for the logic.

- I read again the 2 previous challenges and I can say that I did improve a little bit about looping, arrays, and conditional. I was able to combine the logic in a function but still I have a lot to learn for the ready made references or methods that can be use that has a multiple logic. For example: reduce(), filter(), map, String(), isInteger() and so on.

## 🗓️ Reflection Note – Wednesday (PHT)
**Date:** 2025-05-28

**🧠 What I’ve Accomplished So Far:**

- Solved multiple challenges on Codewars and Edabit ✅

- Wrote and refined clean JavaScript functions using my own logic 💡

- Started a GitHub repo to document my full-stack developer journey 🌐

- Created and maintained a well-organized Trello study board with structured lists and checklists ✅

**🔍 What I Noticed:**

- I’m getting better at understanding logic after writing or reviewing code.

- I rely on AI initially, but I grasp the logic afterward, which helps solidify my learning.

- Time management is improving with structured scheduling.

**📌 Things to Improve:**

- Try solving more challenges without any assistance first to boost logic development.

- Spend 5–10 minutes reviewing documentation or core concepts weekly.

- Keep my refactor-notes.md updated consistently.

**🧘 Today's Intention:**

- Take a step back, reflect on how far I’ve come, and recharge. Progress doesn’t always mean writing code—it can also mean strengthening my mindset and strategy.
