# [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)
**Follow this Hello World exercise to learn GitHub's pull request workflow.**


## Introduction
- This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

- In this quickstart guide, you will:

    - Create and use a repository.
    - Start and manage a new branch.
    - Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits.
    - Open and merge a pull request.


---

## Prerequisites
- You must have a GitHub account. 

- You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on).


---

## Step 1: Create a repository

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click New repository.
2. In the "Repository name" box, type hello-world.
3. In the "Description" box, type a short description. For example, type "This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow."
4. Select whether your repository will be Public or Private.
5. Select Add a README file.
6. Click Create repository.

---

## Step 2: Create a branch

- **Creating a branch**

    1. Click the Code tab of your hello-world repository.

    2. Above the file list, click the dropdown menu that says main.

    3. Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the text box.

    4. Click Create branch: readme-edits from main.

---

## Step 3: Make and commit changes

1. Under the readme-edits branch you created, click the README.md file.

2. To edit the file, click ‚úè(pencil icon).

3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.

4. Click Commit changes.

5. In the "Commit changes" box, write a commit message that describes your changes.

6. Click Commit changes.

---

## Step 4: Open a pull request

- Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

1. Click the Pull requests tab of your hello-world repository.

2. Click New pull request.

3. In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with main (the original).

4. Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.

5. Click Create pull request.

6. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.

7. Click Create pull request.

---

## Step 5: Merge your pull request

1. At the bottom of the pull request, click Merge pull request to merge the changes into main.

2. Click Confirm merge. You will receive a message that the request was successfully merged and the request was closed.

3. Click Delete branch. Now that your pull request is merged and your changes are on main, you can safely delete the readme-edits branch. If you want to make more changes to your project, you can always create a new branch and repeat this process.

4. Click back to the Code tab of your hello-world repository to see your published changes on main.
