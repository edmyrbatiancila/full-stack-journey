## üìöPart 1: Configuring your GitHub account

- Every person who uses GitHub has their own personal account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and represents you as an individual.

1. **Creating an account**
    - To sign up for an account, navigate to https://github.com/ and follow the prompts.

2. **Choosing your GitHub product**
    - You can choose GitHub Free or GitHub Pro to get access to different features for your personal account. You can upgrade at any time if you are unsure at first which product you want.

3. **Verifying your email address**
    - To ensure you can use all the features in your GitHub plan, verify your email address after signing up for a new account. For more information, see [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address).

4. **Configuring two-factor authentication**

    - Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. We strongly urge you to configure 2FA for the safety of your account. For more information, see About [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication).
    
    - Optionally, after you have configured 2FA, add a passkey to your account to enable a secure, passwordless login. See [Managing your passkeys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/authenticating-with-a-passkey/managing-your-passkeys).

5. **Viewing your GitHub profile and contribution graph**

    - Your GitHub profile tells people the story of your work through the repositories and gists you've pinned, the organization memberships you've chosen to publicize, the contributions you've made, and the projects you've created.


## üè´Part 2: Using GitHub's tools and processes
- To best use GitHub, you'll need to set up Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. To effectively collaborate on GitHub, you'll write in issues and pull requests using GitHub Flavored Markdown.

1. **Learning Git**

    - GitHub's collaborative approach to development depends on publishing commits from your local repository to GitHub for other people to view, fetch, and update using Git. 

2. **Setting up Git**

    - Basically in this topic, it described what are other ways to setup Git or you can also install a Git Desktop which is the same platform in github website, but this approach is more personalized and there is a UI that you can use for managing your repository by clicking buttons for commimting, pulling, merging and pushing your changes.

3. **Choosing how to interact with GitHub**

    - In this topic it discusses on how to interact with the Github, By using either Github Desktop, Git commandline, GitHub Flow.

    - It also mentioned in this topic that there is a special way on how to update the changes on your repository by going to codespace which is a feature in GitHub. Due to this, the code is very secured and can be available in the cloud. But the disadvantage is for you to have a strong internet connection.

    - There is also a popular approach on interacting with the repository without needing an internet connection just make sure that your tools is working fine when doing so. So in this approach you need to successfully clone the repository from the remote and put it on your local machine. All the necessary changes will be done in your local changes, if you are ready to push your changes to your remote that is the time that you will need an internet connection.

4. **Writing on GitHub**

    - To make your communication clear and organized in issues and pull requests, you can use GitHub Flavored Markdown for formatting, which combines an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax with some custom functionality.
