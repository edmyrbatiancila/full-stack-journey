- ðŸ“Œ [Hoisting in JavaScript ðŸ”¥(variables & functions) | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnlnw8uY6jo&list=PLlasXeu85E9cQ32gLCvAvr9vNaUccPVNP&index=4)
  

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I learned how hoisting works in JavaScriptâ€”specifically how the JavaScript engine prioritizes which variables or functions are processed first, and which ones may cause errors if not handled properly.

- I now understand why using var can be risky. Unlike let and const, var is function-scoped and does not respect block-level scoping, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

- I really enjoyed the Namaste JavaScript video. The explanations were clear, especially around how JavaScript creates execution contexts, which have two components: memory allocation and code execution.


## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- Iâ€™ve already been introduced to var, let, and const as variable declarations. Todayâ€™s focus helped me deepen my understanding of var, especially its relevance in older codebases.

- I remember encountering var in a legacy project at work. Back then, debugging was difficult because I didnâ€™t fully understand how var behaves. Now, I feel more confident working with older JavaScript code that uses var.

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- Today I focused more on reading and note-taking, as Iâ€™m still recovering from feeling unwell. Despite that, I was able to absorb a lotâ€”reading articles and watching helpful video content about hoisting and variable declarations.

- My main goal was to fully understand the theory before jumping back into more hands-on exercises. Once I feel better, I plan to return to my full routine.

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- At first, hoisting was very confusing, especially when trying to understand the difference between how var, let, and const are hoisted.

- However, after going through multiple resources and explanations, I now understand how hoisting works and how to avoid common mistakes, like referencing variables before theyâ€™re declared.


## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- Continue reading and reinforcing these concepts.

- Start applying this knowledge in small exercises or practical code examples when I feel fully recovered.


## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- Taking a rest yesterday really helpedâ€”I feel more refreshed and less overwhelmed today.

- Iâ€™m proud that Iâ€™m still on track and maintaining my daily study routine. Compared to when I started in bootcamp, I now find reading documentation and technical articles genuinely enjoyable.

- Most importantly, I now have a clear direction and purpose in my learning. That clarity keeps me motivated every day.
