## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I learned about **Lexical Environment**, which is essentially the hierarchy of how functions are invoked and how variables are resolved based on where they are defined in the code.
- Namaste JavaScript helped me visualize how one function is lexically related to another, and how closures behave based on their outer lexical scope.
- I absorbed the core examples discussed in the video, which clarified how JavaScript determines which variable to use during execution.
- I now understand that in a Lexical Environment, there is a structured hierarchy: **global**, **function-level (local)**, and nested **parent-child** scopes.

## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- Previously, I knew that variables declared with `var` could be accessed globally in some cases, even when defined inside functions. However, I didn't know this behavior was part of a larger concept called the **lexical environment**.
- Now, I can clearly connect this behavior to how closures and scope chains work. Understanding the **"where itâ€™s defined"** principle makes the language more predictable.

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- I practiced running several code snippets in the browser console to test my understanding of lexical environments and how scope chains behave.
- I successfully implemented a closure in one of my projects by calling a function inside another and accessing variables from the outer scope.

---

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- Todayâ€™s concepts werenâ€™t too difficult, especially since I had already experimented with closures previously. However, encountering the term **Lexical Environment** for the first time felt a bit overwhelmingâ€”until I broke it down using simple examples.
- What surprised me was how often Iâ€™ve used these patterns before, without knowing the proper terminology.

## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- Continue with the next set of topics in **Advanced JavaScript (Part 1)**â€”especially execution context, call stack, and the event loop.
- Review more interactive examples that demonstrate scope and closures in real-world scenarios.

---

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- Today was a very productive day. I gained a deeper understanding of lexical environments, scope chaining, and how closures work under the hood.
- Iâ€™m proud of being able to implement a closure on my own, and it feels rewarding to understand the reasoning behind itâ€”not just the syntax.
- I'm excited to keep the momentum going and continue deepening my JavaScript knowledge.
