## ðŸ‘“ Topic(s) Covered
- ðŸ“Œ [Promise â€“ JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/promise-basics)  
- ðŸ“Œ [JavaScript Promises In 10 Minutes â€“ Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvZLI7Db8E)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I learned that **Promises** are a powerful way to manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript, helping avoid *callback hell* by allowing cleaner, more readable chaining of functions.
- Promises take two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`.  
  - `resolve` is called when an operation completes successfully.  
  - `reject` is triggered when an error occurs during execution.
- Once a promise is either resolved or rejected, it cannot be changedâ€”only one outcome is allowed per promise.
- The `.then()` and `.catch()` methods simplify error handling and logic flow, especially when working with tasks like fetching data from APIs.

## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- Previously, I was more comfortable using `async/await` with `try/catch`, and I didn't fully understand how Promises worked under the hood.
- Studying Promises now gives me a deeper appreciation for how `async/await` is built on top of Promises.
- Iâ€™m starting to see situations where using raw Promises might still be useful or necessaryâ€”especially in older codebases or libraries.

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- I walked through multiple code examples and carefully read through Promise syntax and use cases.
- I didnâ€™t build anything concrete today, but my focus was understanding how Promises work step by step.

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- No specific issues today. The concept was clear thanks to both the article and the video.
- My main challenge will be applying this to real-world scenarios, which I plan to address later in the week.

## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- Continue reading the remaining sections in the Promises chapter on JavaScript.info.
- Try building a simple app that fetches mock API data using Promises (without `async/await`) for better mastery.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- Although Promises still feel a bit abstract, I now understand their importance and how they operate.
- Iâ€™m proud of myself for picking up my routine again after last weekâ€™s break. Studying after work is getting easier now that Iâ€™m regaining momentum.
