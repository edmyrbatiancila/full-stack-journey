## ðŸ‘“Topic : [Getting started with your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)

- I learned how to get started with using a GitHub account. The platform offers many useful features, and one of the most important things I learned is the importance of enabling **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**. This adds an extra layer of security to protect your account and repositories from unauthorized access.

- I could relate this topic to how I normally connect my local machine to GitHub. Iâ€™ve also experienced smooth collaboration with my senior through **pull request workflows**. This approach ensures that changes made on feature branches are reviewed and merged into the main branch systematically, reducing the risk of conflicts and keeping the project organized.



## ðŸ’ªTopic: [Git Skill: GitHub Pages](https://github.com/edmyrbatiancila/skills-github-pages)

- This was a fun and interactive exercise where I successfully created a simple web page using GitHub Pages. It reinforced how useful this feature is for publishing static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

- I already had experience with GitHub Pages through Angela Yuâ€™s course, so I was familiar with the process. Revisiting this topic made me more confident in deploying websites from repositories.

- Overall, I feel very comfortable with this skill and appreciate the hands-on nature of the exercise.
