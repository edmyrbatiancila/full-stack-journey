## ðŸ‘“Topic : [Getting started with your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)

- I learned in this article on how to start using your GitHub account. There are a lot of ways to do in this platform, for instance you as a user you should consider creating a 2FA(Two Factor Authentication) to make sure that your account is fully secured and nothing to lose if ever someone will try to hack your account or do something about your repositories created.

- I am also able to relate on how I usually connect my account to GitHub and was able to collaborate with my senior smoothly because of the approach that we used together. This approach is about merging request to the branch you are working on to the main branch. It should be in a well maintained way to make sure that the changes or any commits that will done will have zero conflicts.
