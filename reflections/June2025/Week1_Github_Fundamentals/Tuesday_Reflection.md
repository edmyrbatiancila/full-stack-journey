## Topics: [Git Skill](https://skills.github.com/)

- I read a couple of articles regarding on how to merge and pull requests at the same time using github. Usually I do this using git command line like, git add . -> git commit -m "initial changes" -> git push -> git checkout main -> git pull origin your-branch-name. Now I realized that this can also be done in the GitHub itself with just one click away.

- I was able to do some exercises by going to Git Skill and copy 2 repositories in there. I am fascinated how Mona assisted me and check my work and progress all throught out the exercises, planning to finish these exercises to learn more about git and github.
