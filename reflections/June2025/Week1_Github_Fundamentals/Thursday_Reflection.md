## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I explored various Git commands beyond the basics (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git merge`, `git checkout`).
- I completed exercises on the **Learn Git Branching Interactive** platform, an open-source visualization tool for Git.
- Learned how to use `git rebase -i HEAD~2` to edit previous commits using an integrated interactive UI.
- Discovered how to use **relative references** (`^`) to move backward through commitsâ€”each caret symbol steps back one commit.
- Practiced `git cherry-pick` to selectively apply specific commit hashes onto another branch. It's possible to cherry-pick multiple commits.
- Got familiar with `git reset` and `git revert` as powerful tools for undoing changes in different ways.
- Gained a deeper understanding of what **HEAD** represents in Git and how to use it effectively to navigate or manage commits.

## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- Even though Iâ€™ve been using Git for a while, I was surprised to learn about shortcut techniques like relative refs to roll back commits.
- In a recent project at work, I encountered an issue where an OJT mistakenly made changes to code I had already merged. I used `git reset` to undo changes in my branch and `git revert` to fix the main branchâ€”without breaking anything. This reinforced todayâ€™s learnings!

---

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- I practiced todayâ€™s lessons by going through the interactive exercises.
- Iâ€™m still working to fully grasp the concept of **rebasing commits across branches**, and Iâ€™ll continue practicing until I understand it well.

---

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- The exercise about **relative refs** was confusing at first, and I struggled to get it right on the first try.
- I want to explore **more advanced Git concepts**. I havenâ€™t finished all the exercises yet, so I plan to continue tomorrow.

## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- **Review/Improve:** Finish the remaining levels in [Learn Git Branching Interactive](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
- **Goal:** Continue deep-diving into Git and GitHub fundamentals and advanced features. Aim to absorb the full concept by the end of the week.

---

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- I really enjoyed todayâ€™s hands-on exercises. It was fun yet challenging to figure out the correct Git commands.
- Sometimes, even with clear instructions, I got stuck and had to reset the level multiple timesâ€”but I learned a lot in the process.
- Iâ€™m proud to say that I correctly answered about 50% of the exercises on my first try, using knowledge built from previous readings and practice.
