## ðŸ‘“ Topic(s) Covered
- ðŸ“Œ [Fork a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?platform=windows&tool=cli)

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I learned that forking a repository is a common way to contribute to open-source projects maintained by other developers.
- I now understand how to **create a pull request** from a forked repository and merge it properly.
- I also read about **repository security practices**, such as keeping sensitive data safe to prevent unauthorized access to open-source projects.

---

## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- This connects to my current work project, where my seniors sometimes ask me to make changes by submitting a merge request through GitLabâ€™s web interface instead of using the command line.
- I also practiced forking a repository, cloning it locally, and merging it. The concept is still new to me, but Iâ€™m motivated to continue studying until I master it.

---

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- I applied what I learned about forking by following a step-by-step exercise on how to fork a repository and work with it.
- Right now, I feel hesitant to fork a real project because I havenâ€™t identified one that truly interests me. I plan to **research and find a suitable open-source project** to contribute to in the future.

---

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- The most difficult part isnâ€™t the command itselfâ€”itâ€™s choosing the **right project to fork**. There are so many options, and itâ€™s overwhelming to pick one, especially without clear direction or interest yet.

---

## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- Since tomorrow is Saturday, Iâ€™ll take a break to avoid burnout.
- Today marks the end of the **Git and GitHub Fundamentals week**. Next week, Iâ€™ll shift my focus to **Advanced JavaScript concepts** as planned.

---

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- I feel great about wrapping up this weekâ€™s Git and GitHub studies. Iâ€™ve learned a lot, and Iâ€™m proud of my consistency.
- That said, I know this is just the beginningâ€”thereâ€™s still much more to learn when it comes to advanced Git and GitHub topics.
