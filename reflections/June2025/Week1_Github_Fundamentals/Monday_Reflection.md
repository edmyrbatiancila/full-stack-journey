## Topics: Git and Github Fundamentals.

- I read 7 article topics from [Github handbook](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git)
- I learned the basic command line to use for Github: git init, git add, git commit, git merge, git pull and git push. These commands are essential to collaborate with the team on working with one repo by having different branches to work on within a team.
- Me personally I already created some repositories during my bootcamp to make sure what I work on in a project will be saved and at the same time maintain in the Github.
- For collaboration I already been working with my colleague using Gitlab, a different platform that focuses on the company's project wherein a group of developers within a company will collaborate for chaging/modifying the project based on every branches they are assigned into.
- So far I can say that I have still so much to learn it is now clear to me what I should learn next.
