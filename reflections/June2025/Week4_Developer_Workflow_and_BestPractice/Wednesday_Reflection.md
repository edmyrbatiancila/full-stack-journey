## ðŸ‘“ Topic(s) Covered
- ðŸ“Œ [Prettier Documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/)
- ðŸ“Œ [ESLint Documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I learned that **Prettier** is a powerful tool for formatting code consistently and cleanly across a project.
- I also learned that **ESLint** is used to detect and highlight bugs or potential issues in code, helping developers maintain code quality and adhere to best practices.

## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- Iâ€™m already familiar with Prettier and use it regularly in my projects. It's incredibly helpful in making my code more readable and easier for my team to understand.
- Using both Prettier and ESLint helps keep my codebase clean and consistent, which is essential when working in a team.

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- I applied both ESLint and Prettier together in my current projects to improve code formatting and detect bugs early.
- I discovered today that Prettier can be used independently of VS Code extensions by installing it directly into the project. I also learned how to configure `.prettierignore` and `.eslintignore` files to exclude certain files or folders from being formatted or linted.

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- I didnâ€™t encounter any major challenges using Prettier and ESLint today. In fact, these tools continue to be incredibly helpful in my workflow.

## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- Continue exploring more advanced configuration options for Prettier and ESLint.
- Reinforce clean coding practices using these tools.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- I feel refreshed and motivated today. I now appreciate even more how essential Prettier and ESLint are in maintaining high-quality code.
- I'm excited to explore more advanced uses of these tools and integrate them deeper into my development workflow.
