## ðŸ‘“ Topic(s) Covered
- ðŸ“Œ [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I learned several essential command-line tools such as `pushd`, `popd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `ls`, and `dir`. These commands allow me to navigate the file system, create and delete folders, move or rename files, and copy files between directories efficiently.
- I explored PowerShell by practicing these commandsâ€”creating, updating, deleting, and moving files and folders. The article provided practical and easy-to-follow explanations, which is especially helpful for developers who struggle to remember command syntax.

## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- I had basic knowledge of command-line usage from collegeâ€”commands like `cd` and `mkdir`â€”but this session significantly expanded my toolkit.
- The hands-on exercises included in the article were straightforward and effective. They reinforced how the commands work and helped me understand their real-world use in development workflows.

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- I followed along with the articleâ€™s step-by-step instructions to practice the commands.
- I also worked on memorizing common commands that I can apply in real projects, especially those involving file system management via the terminal.

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- The biggest challenge is memorizing and internalizing all the commands. There are so many to remember, and it's easy to mix them up if I donâ€™t use them frequently.
- Iâ€™d like to explore even more advanced command-line tools that developers use daily to increase efficiency.

## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- Continue studying developer workflow tools and best practices.
- Explore the use of **GitHub CLI** and how it can streamline my development process directly from the terminal.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- I feel productive and motivated after todayâ€™s session. Revisiting and expanding my command-line skills not only refreshed my memory but also gave me more confidence as a developer.
- I'm proud of how much I've learned in a short amount of time, and I'm excited to apply this knowledge to my future projects.
