## ðŸ‘“ Topic(s) Covered
- ðŸ“Œ [ESLint Setup Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started)
- ðŸ“Œ [Prettier: Code Formatter Docs](https://prettier.io/docs/install)
- ðŸ“Œ [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I learned how to install Prettier directly into my project by following the official installation guide.
- I also followed the ESLint documentation to configure it within my project directory.
- The Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide helped me understand common coding mistakes and how to avoid them. It gave me practical tips on writing clean, consistent JavaScript code.

## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- Since Iâ€™ve used Prettier before as a VS Code extension, installing and configuring it inside a project folder was easier for me to grasp.
- Learning how to integrate ESLint alongside Prettier deepened my understanding of how these tools complement each other in maintaining code quality.

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- I created a sample project directory and installed both Prettier and ESLint.
- I configured them and tested how they work together by writing and formatting some JavaScript files.
- Even though the documentation is lengthy, working hands-on helped me understand the tools better, especially the installation and configuration process.

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- The main challenge today was absorbing all the detailed documentation for both ESLint and Prettier. Each tool has its own setup instructions, features, and best practices, so studying both at once had a bit of a learning curve.
- Despite this, I now have a strong foundational understanding of why these tools are essential for any serious development workflow.

## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- Continue learning how to use and configure developer tools by reading more documentation and experimenting in small projects.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- I feel great about todayâ€™s progress! Installing and setting up Prettier and ESLint manually gave me more control and confidence, and now I can use them in projects even without relying on VS Code extensions.
