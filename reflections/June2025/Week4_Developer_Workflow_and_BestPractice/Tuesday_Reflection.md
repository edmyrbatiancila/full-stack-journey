## ðŸ‘“ Topic(s) Covered
- ðŸ“Œ [GitHub CLI Manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
- I explored the GitHub CLI and learned how to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal using commands that start with `gh`.
- I discovered that each CLI command has a specific use caseâ€”for example, creating a repository, authenticating a user, or managing pull requests.
- I successfully authenticated my GitHub account using `gh auth login`.

## ðŸ”„ How It Connects to What I Already Know
- This was my first time learning about the GitHub CLI as an alternative to traditional Git commands used in Git Bash.
- Previously, I relied on Git Bash to create repositories, commit changes, and push code. Learning `gh` commands showed me there are more efficient, task-specific tools available.
- The GitHub CLI adds another layer of productivity and allows more seamless integration with GitHub workflows.

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced or Applied
- I installed GitHub CLI using Winget and verified its setup by authenticating my account.
- I focused on essential `gh` commands such as `gh repo create`, `gh repo clone`, and `gh pr create`, taking notes on their usage.
- I limited my exploration to the most commonly used commands to avoid overwhelm and to build foundational knowledge first.

## ðŸ›  Challenges or Questions
- Memorizing all the available commands is challenging, especially since many differ from traditional Git syntax.
- I plan to continue practicing by using the GitHub CLI in small real-world tasks, like managing pull requests or cloning repos.

## âœ… Action Steps for Tomorrow
- Continue reading more about GitHub CLI features and deepen my understanding of its integration in real projects.
- Apply some of the commands by managing a sample repository through the CLI.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
- I'm satisfied with todayâ€™s progress. I now have a clear understanding of what the GitHub CLI is and how it enhances productivity.
- While it has a learning curve, I find it exciting to have a more powerful and direct way to interact with GitHub without leaving the terminal.
